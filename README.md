An interactive exploration of global CO₂ emissions (1750–2021), revealing how economic growth, population, and shifting industrial power—from the UK to the US and now China—shape today’s climate challenges.

### Abstract
This project analyzes global CO₂ emissions from 1750 to 2021, revealing how emission leadership has shifted alongside industrialization and economic growth. In the early industrial period, the United Kingdom dominated global emissions, but its contribution declined significantly following technological transitions and environmental reforms. By the late 19th century, the United States emerged as the leading emitter, with emissions rising steadily until the mid-2000s. Since then, China has overtaken all other countries, accounting for over 48% of global CO₂ emissions in 2021, followed by the United States and India.

The analysis highlights a growing concentration of emissions in developing and emerging economies, particularly China and India, reflecting rapid industrialization and rising consumption. A strong relationship between population size and CO₂ emissions is evident, especially in economies such as China, India, Nigeria, and the United States, where development priorities often outweigh environmental considerations. Weak emissions regulation and the emphasis on consumption-driven growth further reinforce this trend, underscoring the structural challenges 


### Project description
The goal of this project was to analyze the historical evolution of global CO₂ emissions from 1750 to 2021 and uncover how emissions patterns have shifted across countries over time. Specifically, the project aimed to:

*  Identify the world’s largest emitters across different historical periods
*  Examine the relationship between population size and CO₂ emissions
*  Compare national contributions to global emissions and changes in global emission shares
*  Highlight the growing role of emerging and developing economies in global emissions
*  Insights are communicated through an interactive dashboard that allows users to explore CO₂ emissions by country and year
* Compare population size against emissions levels
* Track how countries’ global emission shares evolve over time
* Identify emerging emitters and long-term structural shifts

By combining maps, trend lines, and comparative scatter plots, the dashboard enables users to quickly move from historical context to policy-relevant interpretation, supporting data-driven climate and sustainability decisions.
